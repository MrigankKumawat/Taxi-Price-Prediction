🚖 Taxi Trip Price Prediction

An end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict taxi fares based on trip details such as distance, time, traffic, weather, and passenger count.
It also includes a Flask API for real-time predictions.

📌 Features

✔️ Predicts taxi trip prices using Gradient Boosting Regressor
✔️ Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering
✔️ Interactive visualizations (box plots, violin plots, heatmaps, scatter plots)
✔️ Cross-validation for model reliability
✔️ Flask API for deployment and Postman testing
